                <p>My name is Nick Pettis, I am 31 and am currently a student in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Online
                    Coding Boot Camp for the 2nd quarter cohort. I live in Fayetteville, GA which is a suburn of
                    Atlanta. I have a background in accounting but am interested starting a new career in computer
                    science. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>A few of my strengths include: attention to detail, persistence, and being initiative.
                        Throughout my career in accouting I learned that I will need to pay close attention to
                        detail when looking at financial statements. Missing one number on an income statement
                        could cause my client to lose hundreds if not thousands of dollars. This will be important
                        once I become a developer because it may cost me several hours looking for one mistake
                        in my code if I am not paying close attention. As a result, this may cause the company I am
                        working for to lose a lot of money. Being persistant was important as an accountant and will be
                        just as important as a developer. There were times that I did not know the exact audit or tax
                        rule while I was an accountant but I was able to use different resources to look for my answer.
                        This showed that I was not going to give up because I did not know the answer to something. In
                        the developer world this will be key when trying to write a new code and not knowing the correct
                        tag or code to use. Having initiative will show that I want to learn new things and take on new
                        resonsibilities. When I began my career in accounting I only worked in the tax department but
                        becasue I wanted to expand my knowledge I asked if I could start helping out with audits as
                        well. This allowed me to have more responsibilities but also take on new challenges. Once I
                        start my career as a developer I am sure I will not start on the biggest project available at
                        the time. But as I gain more knowledge I will be able to ask to ask for more challenging work
                        along with more responsibilities.
