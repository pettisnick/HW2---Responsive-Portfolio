                        <p>My name is Nick Pettis, I am 31 and am currently a student in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack
                            Online
                            Coding Boot Camp for the 2nd quarter cohort. I currently live in Fayetteville, GA which is a
                            suburn
                            just south of Atlanta. I have lived in Fayetteville my entire life except for when I went
                            off to
                            college. My first year of college I stayed home and commuted to a junior college, Gordon
                            State College, in
                            Barnesville, GA. It was only about a 40 minute drive so it wasn't that bad. I transferred
                            out after
                            my first year and went to Auburn University in Auburn, AL. I finished up my final three
                            years there
                            earning a BS in accounting. While at Auburn I was a student employee for the football team.
                            I filmed
                            the every football practice and game my final two years of college. Once back home I began
                            working
                            at a local CPA firm in Peachtree City, GA. I ended up working there for six years. While
                            there I
                            attended Clayton State University in Morrow, GA, where I earned my MBA with a concentration
                            in
                            Accounting. I have a background in accounting but am interested starting a new career in
                            computer
                            science.

                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            <p>A few of my strengths include: attention to detail, persistence, and being initiative.
                                Throughout my career in accouting I learned that I will need to pay close attention to
                                detail when looking at financial statements. Missing one number on an income statement
                                could cause my client to lose hundreds if not thousands of dollars. This will be
                                important
                                once I become a developer because it may cost me several hours looking for one mistake
                                in my code if I am not paying close attention. As a result, this may cause the company I
                                am
                                working for to lose a lot of money. Being persistant was important as an accountant and
                                will be
                                just as important as a developer. There were times that I did not know the exact audit
                                or tax
                                rule while I was an accountant but I was able to use different resources to look for my
                                answer.
                                This showed that I was not going to give up because I did not know the answer to
                                something. In
                                the developer world this will be key when trying to write a new code and not knowing the
                                correct
                                tag or code to use. Having initiative will show that I want to learn new things and take
                                on new
                                resonsibilities. When I began my career in accounting I only worked in the tax
                                department but
                                becasue I wanted to expand my knowledge I asked if I could start helping out with audits
                                as
                                well. This allowed me to have more responsibilities but also take on new challenges.
                                Once I
                                start my career as a developer I am sure I will not start on the biggest project
                                available at
                                the time. But as I gain more knowledge I will be able to ask to ask for more challenging
                                work
                                along with more responsibilities.
